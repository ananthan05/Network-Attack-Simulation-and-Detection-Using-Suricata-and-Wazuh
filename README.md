# Simulating and Detecting LAN Attacks Using Wazuh and Suricata

This project demonstrates how to simulate and detect 14 different LAN-based network attacks using an isolated virtual lab environment. It combines offensive (attacks) and defensive (detection) techniques using powerful open-source tools: **Wazuh** (SIEM), **Suricata** (IDS/IPS), and **Bettercap** (attack simulation).

## üß™ Lab Overview

- **Attacker VM**: Kali Linux  to perform LAN-based attacks.
- **Victim VM**: Ubuntu with Suricata (IDS/packet capture), Zeek (network traffic analysis), and Wazuh agent..
- **Server VM**: Wazuh Manager for collecting and analyzing security events.

## üéØ Objectives

- Simulate 11 Network-based attacks.
- Detect and analyze these attacks using Suricata and Wazuh.
- Collect `.pcap` files for packet-level investigation.
- Generate centralized logs and alerts.
- Document findings with step-by-step attack execution and detection.
